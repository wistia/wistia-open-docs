## Create a new Project

To create a new project, select *New Project* from under the
<span class="action_menu">Actions</span> menu. A new Project will be created,
and you will immediately be taken in where you can upload content, invite
contacts, and edit the project name.

## Copy an existing Project

To copy a Project, select *Copy Project* from under the
<span class="action_menu">Actions</span> menu.

{% post_image hashed_id: '99e00bd8938dbc9276a7facf9bdcaadd8f8cbe6a', class: 'center' %}

This will launch a dialogue box with a drop-down menu that contains all your
Projects. Choosing one from the drop-down will create a duplicate of the Project.

## The Project Title

The title of the Project is how you will find it in your Account. By default,
the title is *Untitled Project*, but that's not what you want!

{% post_image hashed_id: 'cbce9f0535fb89126b318d20db60d6bc338014d0', class: 'center' %}

To edit the title, hover over it with your mouse, and click the
Edit button. Edit the title text, and click the Save button at the bottom of the form
to finish editing.

Changing the title of the Project won't affect embed codes or links, either.

## Add a description to your Project


To add a description to your project, hover over the project title,
and click the Edit button that appears. Add your description text
to the second field in the form and click Save to publish your changes.

{% post_image hashed_id: '654501f8da59ccbbe89e0cb9d1dc8744e995a434', class: 'center' %}

You can type plain text into the description field or you can use markdown to style the text
and put images or links into your description. Clicking the link "Formatting with Markdown"
will open a guide explaining more about markdown.

## Sharing Access to Projects

Projects can be in two modes: **unlocked** and **locked**. By default, they are
set to *unlocked*.

* **Unlocked** projects can be accessed by anyone with the link. Your content is
still not findable/searchable on Google, but this setting makes it quick and
painless to share your videos with someone else.
* **Locked** projects can only be accessed when the viewer is invited by email.

To see or adjust your current project's setting, open the *Sharing & Privacy*
area under the <span class='action_menu'>Project Actions</span> menu.

{% post_image hashed_id: 'b7f77d7e188bc953dfd491ae12d9476ee44f5c2c', class: 'center' %}

{{ "Shortcut! You can access this screen by clicking the <i class='icon-lock'></i> icon next to the Project title." | note }}

If you want to share your project, and all the videos within it,
you would set your project to *unlocked*, and then share the
URL with viewers. That link would look something like:

`mydomain.wistia.com/projects/xGFHnn33`

Viewers who followed that URL would be able to access all media in the Project.

If, however, you only shared the URL for a single video, the viewer would only
have access to that video - not the entire project. Tricky, huh?

Sharing a Project by Email and Link with other viewers is also covered in-depth
on the [private sharing documentation page]({{ '/private-sharing' | post_url }}).

## Playlists

**Playlists** are a video player for multiple videos - all the videos in your
account. You can select `</> Embed Playlist` to get started, or head over to
the [playlists doc page]({{ '/playlists' | post_url }}) for more information.

## Project Sections

Project sections allow you to organize media within a project. Media can be put
into project sections and the sections can then expanded or collapsed to provide
a cleaner experience for projects with many media.

{% post_image hashed_id: '7832934fe67fb18882143b3532fb037d44fa529a', class: 'center' %}

To create a section, select `+ New section` from the Project Actions menu.
A new section will be created, which you can name, and drag-and-drop media into.

To give the Section a title, hover over the title text, select the
<span class="edit_tag"></span>, update the text, and then press `Enter`.

## Delete a Project

To delete a project, select *Delete Project* from under the
<span class="action_menu">Project Actions</span> menu.

{% post_image hashed_id: '206d83a6cf49018acfa4a6ee39d8f2d393f1f0fc', class: 'center' %}

Say *sayonara* to that project!
