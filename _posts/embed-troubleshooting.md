While Wistia embed codes should work properly out of the box, it can definitely be tricky to make them work _just right_ in certain situations. Here are some common challenges, and how to overcome them. Never give up. Never surrender.


## Popover embed taking over the full browser window

Instead of "popping over" the rest of the page in a lightbox, does your video take up the full browser window? This can happen when the popover script, `<script charset="ISO-8859-1" src="//fast.wistia.com/assets/external/popover-v1.js"></script>`, has either been removed from the page, or is unable to function properly due to a conflict with other code. Check the page source to make sure that script is present. 

## Black bars on the top and bottom or sides of the video

## Loading...

## Video not displaying on mobile devices

## Video not resizing correctly

## Video not collecting stats

## Video not showing up in search results
